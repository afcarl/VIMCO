#Variational Inference for Monte Carlo objectives (VIMCO)

This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the results of the VIMCO paper using Theano.

Usage:

```
python main.py experiment/
```

After 2000 epochs this leads to a variational lower bound of -91.33 for 5 samples (paper obtains -93.6).
